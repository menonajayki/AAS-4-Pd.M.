# Asset Administration Shells-for-Predictive-Maintenance
The program is created as a part of Research Project with the University of Stuttgart. 

* AAS and Submodels are created through BaSyx
* The data base is through CouchDB
* The AAS is created for V and I from a Battery, this is analyzed through iForest
* SoC Calculation is also performed

Through this study it is proven that BaSyx combined with AASX Packages are the best tools for AAS implementation
